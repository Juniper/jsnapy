Bugs
----

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository.

Please read the following guidelines before you 
[report an issue](https://github.com/Juniper/jsnapy/issues).

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** -- check if the issue has
   already been reported. If it has been, please comment on the existing issue.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** â€” Various point-release branches, such
   as ``2016.3``, ``2016.11``, or even ``develop``, may already contain
   a fix. Please try to reproduce the bug against the latest git ``HEAD`` or
   the latest release.

3. **Isolate the demonstrable problem** -- make sure that the
   code in the project's repository is *definitely* responsible for the issue.

4. **Include a reproducible example** -- Provide the steps which
   led you to the problem.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report, too. What is your
environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What Operating System? What
would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to
assess and fix any potential bugs.

**Including the junos version on which the tool was used, will be helpful too.**

Valid bugs will be categorized for the next release and worked on as quickly
as resources can be reasonably allocated.


Features
--------

JSNAPy feature additions and requests are
welcomed. When requesting a feature, its feasibility and requirement will be discussed and
marked with "Enhancement" Label, and made ready in the in next release.

If a new feature is desired, the fastest way to get it into JSNAPy is to
contribute the code. Before starting on a new feature, an issue should be filed
for it. The one requesting the feature will be able to then discuss the feature
with the JSNAPy team and discover the best way to get the feature into JSNAPy,
if the feature makes sense.

It is extremely common that the desired feature has already been completed.
Look for it in the docs, ask about it on the mailing list
before filing the request. It is also common that the problem which would be
solved by the new feature can be easily solved another way, which is a great
reason to ask first.
